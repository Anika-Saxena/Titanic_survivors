# Titanic_survivors
Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Titanic

Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for a machine learning project that predicts the survival rate of passengers aboard the Titanic. The project uses various factors like age, gender, ticket class, and others to determine what factors made it favorable for a person to survive the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, sex, ticket class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and whether they survived or not.

Notebook
The analysis and model training were performed in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook is named "Titanic_survivors.ipynb" and can be found in the Notebooks directory. It includes all the steps from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:

Notebooks: Contains the Jupyter notebook with the analysis and code.
Data: Contains the Titanic dataset in CSV format.
Results: Contains the saved model, evaluation metrics, and other results.

Installation
To run the notebook on your local machine, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
